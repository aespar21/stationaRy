      The `get_met_data()` function gets meteorological data from a station.
      Specify the station ID, the years of data required, and the **stationaRy**
      package will do the rest (i.e., give you a tibble of met data).

      Two functions provide some useful information. The
      `get_station_metadata()` function yields a tibble that is essentially a 
      catalog of all the met stations available. The all-important station ID
      values are in here, along with location information and years for which
      data is available. The `station_coverage()` function makes it easy to
      determine which additional data fields (above and beyond the standard set
      of observations) are available for a given station.
